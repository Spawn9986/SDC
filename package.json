It consists of a React front-end, back-end API using Node and Express, and persisting data in a Postresql database.  * The front end in React is based off https://github.com/mdn/todo-react, which is just a React front-end that uses only mock data. Fetch API calls were added to connect it to a back-end    * The back end is an Express server in Node.js which uses the Sequelize ORM to connect to the postgres database.   * Note - Migration and Seed data files are supplied for the sequelize-cli, but are not yet configured to work in Docker",
